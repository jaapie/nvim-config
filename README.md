# nvim-config
This is an almost 1-to-1 copy of my old ViM configuration from my (dotfiles)[https://github.com/jaapie/dotfiles]
repository. It adds LSP for ruby and tailwindcss, and uses a number of Tim Pope and Wincent plugins.

## Thanks
Thanks to Wincent for his status line functions and pinnacle plugins which helped me get this setup working.

## Copying
This is Unlicenced work so you can copy at will. I've only added work from others where that work is Unlicenced as
well. If you think I've copied something from you and you want credit, please let me know.
